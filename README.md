# Heartfailure-Patient-Survival-Analysis-
This is a master project in the second year, Semester 1 2021, supervisor: Dr. Nicola Armstrong
1. the project focus on machine learning techiniques in surivial anaysis based on previous work from 
2. There are clinical information for 150 patients in saudi arbia country, the record was mannually organised by the staff in the hospital
3. No cross validation procedure is incoprated in the analysis. which in generally degrede the credit of the results presented. 
4. It is just rather intresting to see that when I was writing down the line, that my new tool dominant in the workplace is power bi instead of any proper programing language.
5. Btw, i really dont like the characteristic of github that autocorrection of spelling is not allowed in most of the modules and all repsitory can be turned iinto private although lots of people just utilise thedefaluting setiting and set the wholedocument to public review (as what i am doing at the moment)
6. to be honest, typing in the workplace is actually pretty much enjoyable and i can precatice my typing skills during the work time so I could type faster when writing my thesis in the future.
7. i heard that there was some one that feel very uset about their jobs even if that young lady work for GS and JP morgan, i still cannot believe she cried a lot about the work because of the lack of passion in general.
8. and her solution for the problem was quite simple, which is just doing her work, gong back home and solving maths problem such as write the proof and induction at her spare time, kegit maths can cure her for a while and help her stop crying so hard 
9. I truly believe the same thing is happening on me except for that i am too tired and exhausted after work and has no enegry to solve my maths problems when going back home, at least for the first 2 days of work.
10. today is the 3rd day of the work and legit i am type these word in the office, i am very looking forward to wear jeans to the office on friday  and my seniorw will come into the office on that day as well. 
11. but in general i prob just feel so frustrated by the work itself as i hate excel let alone power bi.... legit seriously, i can be a technician but power bi??? okay, i think i will just work for the money from now.
12. but but anyway, i will finish this peiece of update about the github later in the day, actually by tonight, and i will leave office at 3pm
